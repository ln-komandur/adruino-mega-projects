If an object is closer than 25 cms from the Ultrasonic distance sensor,
  - Wave a small stick on a micro servo motor
  - Display "Hello!" on the LCD line 1

If the object is more than 25 cms away from the Ultrasonic distance sensor,
  - Display "The Distance is " on the LCD line 1

In either case, on the LCD line 2, display distance in CMs followed by " cm(s)."

To measure distances accurately using the ultra sonic pulse, find the temperature using DHT11 sensor and calculate the speed of sound () at that temperature
